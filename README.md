# Neeter
An open source and decentralized chat-based social network. This repo contains both the Neeter backend and web frontend (horizon), for a simple and easy hosting experience.

**IMPORTANT -** This repository currently contains unstable and non optimized code, and it's been tested only on our hardware. For self hosting Neeter, please wait until the beta release comes out.
